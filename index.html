    <h1>Adrian Tandiono &nbsp; エイドリアン・タンデイオーノ</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Adrian my favourite activity is probably <strong>gaming</strong>
            but i also love to read <strong>books</strong> and watch <strong>anime</strong> whenever I have nothing else to do.</p>

    <h2>Gaming &nbsp; ゲーム</h2>
        <p>The games I currently am playing the most is
            <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/" title="Star Citizen's Website" target="_blank"><strong>Star Citizen</strong></a>
        it is a sim type game that tries to simulate an as realistic breathing universive with diverse planets and star systems in a MMO format.</p>

    <h3>Anime &nbsp; アニメ</h3>
        <p>I watch a lot of anime and also read a lot of manga but my favourite anime this season has to be
        <strong>SpyXFamily</strong> because it is really wholesome anime about family but still has cool and
        flued action scenes.</p>
